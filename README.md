#Journal Reflection

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the DriverPass project was the CEO of the company.  They system that was requested was one where the customer could sign up online for packages that incorporated some type of driving lesson and potential access to an online testing environment.  The goal of the system was to allow the customer to self serve as much as possible, with the ability to contact the company directly if needed.  The driving lessons were to be scheduled through the site and maintain user data to coordinate times and locations with the drivers.  The testing environment was to maintain a list of regularly updated questions from the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?

My activity diagrams were very thorough and followed a logical progression of the actions that would need to be taken to reach the desired outcome.  They covered as many potential scenarios as I believe could occur duing the specific activity. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise any of the projects from this class, I would choose the Business Requirements document.  Not because I think there is anything wrong with it as is, but I believe it could always be refined to better suit the needs of the client.  Ideally, I would have liked to have taken the original requirements to the client and get their sign off on what they liked and clarification on anything that could be better.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I made sure the user would be able to easily access the entire system from their online account.  The main goal of the project was to provide the service in a way that allowed the user to self serve as much as possible.  By focusing on the user's needs, I was able to design the system in a way that gave the user as much freedom as possible while still making the user experience simple.  They will be guided through each of the options on the site and can access content on their time.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I gather as much information as possible before beginning anything else.  I form a working theory of how best to complete the project and then compare it to the information I have gathered.  Once all the information is gathered, I create an outline of the necessary components of the code and draft pseudocode.  Once the logic is fine, I will proceed with the coding.  When designing a system in the future, I will make sure to continue to gather as much information as possible.  Unless I am completely clear on the specific needs and functions of the system, planning should not commence.  I will also regularly compare the working model of the project to the goal in order to make sure the final product is to specifications.
